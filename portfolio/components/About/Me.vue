        <p>Hello! I got my first taste of Web Design in 10th grade when I enrolled in a web design course at my local technical school. I was immediatly hooked, any chance I got I was created websites, experimenting with new (to me) technology, and wanted to learn more. After graduating (Highschool and Technical School) I went on to college. I am currently a senior at the University of Central Oklahoma, majoring in MIS.</p>
        <p>While I am pursing my degree, I currently work at Funds For Learning as Information Services Developer (Web Developer). I help maintain and enhance the current website, as well as develop spin-off websites for a few of our clients.</p>
